/**
 * This package contains utilities to automate some of the JSON parsing tasks
 * in ARCADE without compromising customization. It works through a mixture of
 * generics, reflection and black magic. Please do not ask me any questions
 * about it, and for the love of god do not touch it. I myself am not sure how
 * or why it works, but it does, and I want nothing more to do with it.
